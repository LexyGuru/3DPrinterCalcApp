### 🔍 System Diagnostics
- **System health check modal**:
  - System information display and validation
  - Memory usage monitoring with warnings
  - File existence checks
  - Module availability checks
  - Data storage availability tests
  - Progress bar and summary display
  - Full localization in all 13 supported languages

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- Logging disabled during Factory Reset to prevent log pollution
- data.json creation delayed until language selection (cleaner Factory Reset process)
- Log file initialization delayed until language selection
- Automatic app restart after language selection
- Backend commands for backup and log file management
- Cross-platform path handling for backups and logs
